{"body":"[NodeFly](http://addons.heroku.com/nodefly) is an [add-on](http://addons.heroku.com) for monitoring Node.js applications.\r\n\r\nNodeFly injects a lightweight analytics tool into your application\r\nallowing you to see exactly what's going on.\r\nThe NodeFly agent tracks overall time per request,\r\nand reports how much time in MySQL, Redis, and other resources.\r\n\r\nNodeFly works well for both development and production,\r\nand has helped many people track down memory-leaks and unexpected latencies.\r\n\r\nNodeFly is accessible via an API and has supported client libraries for Node.js.\r\n\r\n## Provisioning the add-on\r\n\r\nNodeFly can be attached to a Heroku application via the  CLI:\r\n\r\nA list of all plans available can be found [here](http://addons.heroku.com/nodefly).\r\n\r\n    $ heroku addons:add nodefly\r\n    -----> Adding nodefly to sharp-mountain-4005... done, v18 (free)\r\n\r\nOnce NodeFly has been added a `NODEFLY_APPLICATION_KEY` setting will be available in the app configuration and will contain the application key required to begin monitoring your application. This can be confirmed using the `heroku config:get` command.\r\n\r\n    $ heroku config:get NODEFLY_APPLICATION_KEY\r\n    00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\r\n\r\nAfter installing NodeFly the application should be configured to fully integrate with the add-on.\r\n\r\nAdd nodefly to your package.json in your web application:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"my-awesome-application\",\r\n        \"dependencies\": {\r\n            \"nodefly\": \"stable\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nEnter the following at the top of your module before any other requires:\r\n\r\n    require('nodefly').profile(\r\n        process.env.NODEFLY_APPLICATION_KEY,\r\n        [process.env.APPLICATION_NAME,'Heroku']\r\n    );\r\n\r\nYou should set `APPLICATION_NAME` using the command line:\r\n    \r\n    $ heroku config:set APPLICATION_NAME <A short but descriptive name>\r\n\r\n## Local setup\r\n\r\n### Environment setup\r\n\r\nAfter provisioning the add-on it’s necessary to locally replicate the config vars so your development environment can operate against the service.\r\n\r\nWhen running locally in development mode, we recommend _changing_ your `APPLICATION_NAME` environment variable.\r\nThis will differentiate the development and production environments in your analytics.\r\nYou do _not_ have to change your `NODEFLY_APPLICATION_KEY`.\r\n\r\nUse [Foreman](//devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile#developing-locally-with-foreman) \r\nto reliably configure and run the process formation specified in your app’s \r\n[Procfile](//devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile#declaring-process-types).\r\nForeman reads configuration variables from an .env file. \r\nUse the following command to add the NODEFLY_APPLICATION_KEY values retrieved from heroku config to `.env`.\r\n\r\n    $ heroku config -s | grep NODEFLY_APPLICATION_KEY >> .env\r\n    $ more .env\r\n\r\n>  We also recommend a pure Node.js implementation of [Foreman](https://npmjs.org/package/foreman).\r\n\r\n## Dashboard\r\n\r\nThe NodeFly dashboard allows you to view the metrics collected by the NodeFly agent.\r\n\r\n![NodeFly Dashboard](//raw.github.com/gist/7242786cbbcf5b044971/aa844493dfdd04bf53c5c9423f9dce8d42a38e62/dashboard.png)\r\n\r\nThe NodeFly Heroku Console can be accessed via the CLI:\r\n\r\n    $ heroku addons:open nodefly\r\n    Opening nodefly for sharp-mountain-4005…\r\n\r\nor by visiting the [Heroku apps web interface](http://heroku.com/myapps) and selecting the application in question. Select NodeFly from the Add-ons menu.\r\n\r\nFrom the console, you can open the dashboard without requiring an additional login, you will be automatically connected to your Heroku instance.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nAfter configuration NodeFly is automatic.\r\nIf you should experience any issues, please let us know immediately.\r\nThere are a number of ways to get help:\r\n\r\n- If you have a copy of the error, you can open a issue on our [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/NodeFly/NodeFly/issues)\r\n- We also accept email question at support@nodefly.com\r\n\r\n## Migrating between plans\r\n\r\nApplication owners should carefully manage the migration timing to ensure proper application function during the migration process.\r\n\r\nUse the `heroku addons:upgrade` command to migrate to a new plan.\r\n\r\n    $ heroku addons:upgrade nodefly:premium\r\n    -----> Upgrading nodefly:premium to sharp-mountain-4005... done, v18 ($49/mo)\r\n           Your plan has been updated to: nodefly:premium\r\n\r\n## Removing the add-on\r\n\r\nNodeFly can be removed via the  CLI.\r\n\r\nThis will destroy all associated data and cannot be undone!\r\n\r\n    $ heroku addons:remove nodefly\r\n    -----> Removing nodefly from sharp-mountain-4005... done, v20 (free)\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
